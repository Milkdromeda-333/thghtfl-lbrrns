TAGLINE:  FROM CURIOSITY TO COMMON CAUSE: Curate with Your Circle of Care to Truly Connect
Transforming a sea of static information into living stories, vetted resources and opportunities to convene as a circle of friends or community with a common cause.
IDEA:
What if we had a platform for stories + way to facilitate circles for organizing around common cause/experts/trusted members, and a cadence for folks convening on relevant issues to help parse and manage all the news and updates associated with complex crisis coming in?
PROBLEM THAT YOUR TEAM IS SOLVING: We have lots of resources and organizations scattered across the internet and nation but itâ€™s missing voices who can help vouch for what to expect when engaging them, or just to discuss and act upon what they inspire.
FOR WHOM ARE YOU SOLVING THE PROBLEM: This app works by organizing people through their close contacts, and anyone who shares common interest via the metadata tags of the content they bookmark.
